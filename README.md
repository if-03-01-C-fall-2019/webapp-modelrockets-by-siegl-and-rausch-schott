# Plans for our WebApp
## Plan
We initially wanted to make a rocket that can be launched with a click of a button, but we decided it would be cooler to make a quiz about rockets and space in general.

## Steps to finished WebApp
* Create nice looking design for Quiz (HTML, CSS)
* Create and fill database with questions
* Connect the website with the database

Tada. . . finished.
