# Plans for our WebApp
## Plan
We initially wanted to make a rocket that can be launched with a click of a button, but we decided it would be cooler to make a quiz about rockets and space in general. 

## Steps to finished WebApp
* Create nice looking design for Quiz (HTML, CSS)
* Create a working JSON-Server
* Collect questions and save them on the server
* Connect the website with the server
